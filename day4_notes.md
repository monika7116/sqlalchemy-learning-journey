ðŸ”¹ Many-to-One

ðŸ”¸ One-to-One Relationship
This means:

One row in Table A â†” Exactly one row in Table B

Example in Payroll System:

One Employee â†’ One Permanent Address

One Employee â†’ One Bank Account Details

ðŸ§± Part 2: One-to-One Relationship in SQLAlchemy
SQLAlchemy doesnâ€™t have a direct one-to-one class â€” instead, we create:

A unique foreign key

A relationship() with uselist=False

ðŸ’¡ Use Case in Project:
One Employee â†” One SalaryAccount
